# Live Object Detection
Training networks to identify live object detection with Tensorflow and OpenCV. Starting with training very basic to measure performance on few live - low quality images with different labels. The networks will be trained with higher quality data later on. Once this project is completed, it will be implemented into a larger project containing rasberry pi.
